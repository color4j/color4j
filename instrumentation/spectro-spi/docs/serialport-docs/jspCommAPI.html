<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><U><FONT SIZE="6">javax.comm API</FONT></U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="4">Implemented entirely with SerialPort</FONT></P>

<P>The Comm API 2.0 (the first release in spite of the version number) has been implemented completely using the
    SerialPort API.</P>

<P><B><U>Limitations of Comm API 2.0 design</U></B></P>

<P>When Sun released the first early version of the Comm API Solutions Consulting implemented that API using SerialPort
    and reported these design problems with the API. Many of the issues reported were apparently ignored by Sun, as
    those issues still remain with the Comm API in the initial release (long after the issues were reported).</P>

<P>There should be some way to determine if some set/is???, and noifyOn??? API methods are supported. The SerialPort
    product does this with the 'isSupported' methods. Since the Comm API does not provide this feature, it should at
    least define some of the methods to throw unsupportedCommOperationException. For example, Macintosh hardware does
    not have DSR or RTS hardware so isDSR and setRTS make absolutely no sense on the Mac. Likewise, notifyOnCD, and
    notifyOnRingIndicator make no sense on the Mac. When using our javax.comm.SerialPort implementation on a platform
    that does not support one of these features (e.g. setDTR on UnixWareIA32) a message similar to the one shown below
    will appear on the console:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">The correct thing to do is to throw an <BR>
    UnsupportedCommOperationException however Sun's API does<BR>
    not define this. For source code compatability with Sun's <BR>
    API we can not do it the correct way. You should contact <BR>
    Sun and encourage them to fix their API. (We suggested <BR>
    they do this in early 1998)</FONT></P>

<P>It also seems odd that methods like setDTR, setRTS, and sendBreak are not declared to throw an IOExcepion.</P>

<P>Note that the Comm API defines isDTR and isRTS methods. From the serial hardware level, these signals are write-only,
    so these methods can be misleading. In addition these methods make no sense on some platforms.</P>

<P>The Comm API provides no method for polling (or to disable event generation). For many applications this is
    not a problem, however for some high-performance applications the overhead of event creation/propagation can be
    limiting. Note also that some platforms may not provide a mechanism to generate interrupts for all of the events
    defined in the Comm API. This means that a thread must be dedicated to polling at the Java level to generate the
    required events.</P>

<P>Dynamic port configuration is a questionable cross-platform strategy. In the Comm API when the methods
    setSerialPortParams
    and setFlowControlMode are called, the driver must reconfigure an open port. Performing port configuration changes
    without resetting the port can be risky since some OS’s do not support the concept, or can have subtle bugs
    associated
    with it. (This is one of the reasons the Solutions Consulting SerialPort API uses the SerialConfig object)</P>

<P>The file name UnsupportedCommOperationException.java is too long for the Mac file system.</P>

<P>The Solutions Consulting SerialPort product has none of these limitations. In fact our implementation of the
    Comm API is done with SerialPort reflecting SerialPort's robust design. By using SerialPort the developer is
    provided
    with maximum flexibility since the Comm API or the SerialPort API can be used.</P>

<P><B><U>Is it 100% Java?</U></B></P>

<P>It is unfortunate, but there seems to be much confusion about what 100% Pure Java means. One of the requirements
    to be 100% pure is that classes do not contain native methods. Since native methods are required to implement the
    Java Virtual Machine (VM) this in effect means that Java itself is not 100% Pure. Only applications can be 100%
    pure Java. Classes for doing things like communicating with serial ports cannot be 100% pure, however this does
    not mean that applications that use these classes cannot be 100% pure. Many 100% pure Java applications/applets
    have been written that use the SerialPort product.</P>

<P>Sun has said that the Comm API provides a Java extension API that allows applications that use the Comm API
    to be certified as 100% pure. Implementations of the Comm API are not 100% pure and thus <B><I>the Comm API
        implementations
        from Sun are not 100% pure, </I></B>any more than other implementations. This is an unfortunate confusion since
    many people tend to think if it comes from Sun it is 100% pure. In summary, applications that use implementations
    of the Comm API should at some future time be capable of being labeled 100% pure, implementations themselves can
    not be 100% pure. Currently even applications that use the Comm API cannot be 100% pure because Sun has not provided
    the specs for testing to KeyLabs (the company that does 100% Java certification).</P>

<P>Note: Using the Comm API 2.0 release your application may in the future be able to be 100% pure, however it
    will be less cross-platform compatible than an application written using the SerialPort API. This is due to the
    above listed design issues with the Comm API release 2.0.</P>

<P><B><U>Installation</U></B></P>

<P>Install SerialPort per instructions. SerialPort must be installed for the Comm API to function.</P>

<P>Update any Serialio files included with the Comm API package (e.g. SerialPortLocal.java, SerInputStream.java)
    and rebuild the Serialio class file(s).</P>

<P>Here are two common ways to install the Comm API classes</P>

<P>You can use the JAR file as follows:</P>

<P>1) Add the jspComm.jar file to the CLASSPATH. For example on Windows if you have jspComm.jar in c:\jsp then
    CLASSPATH=…;c:\jsp\jspComm.jar;…</P>

<P>Or do it this way if you have the separate classes:</P>

<P>1) Create a directory named javax.comm (case sensitive) that is a subdirectory of where the main Java Comm API
    classes will exist e.g. on Windows create the directory C:\jsp\javax\comm</P>

<P>2) Copy the Comm API class files into the directory created in 1).</P>

<P>3) Add the <I>parent</I> directory of the javax.comm directory to the CLASSPATH. For this example on Windows
    CLASSPATH=…;c:\jsp;… <BR>
</P>

<P><B><U>Port enumeration</U></B></P>

<P>Note enumeration requires that the OS provide some type of ‘registry’ functionality, this is not provided on
    all platforms. The Solutions Consulting implementation is very flexible in that it provides the developer the direct
    ability to add ports in case the developer does not wish to rely on enumeration. This is done as follows:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">CommPortIdentifier.addPortName(devName, CommPortIdentifier.PORT_SERIAL, null);</FONT></P>

<P>Where devName is the device name (e.g. &quot;COM2&quot;, &quot;/dev/tty1&quot;, &quot;Modem Port&quot;). Note
    that the Driver parameter is set to null. This indicates you simply want to add a name to the list, and use the
    the default (Solutions Consulting) driver.</P>

<P>You can see an example of this in the Comm API version of TermTest.java.</P>

<P>You can also hard code device names into the list by modifying JSPDriver.java. <BR>
    &nbsp; <BR>
    <B><U>Events</U></B></P>

<P>The term <I>event</I> is misleading. Those who have worked with serial ports at the UART level might immediately
    think that this means these would be hardware interrupt driven. This certainly makes sense, if the platform serial
    port drivers supported such an interface, unfortunately many do not. Even for those platforms that do provide some
    event type of event interface <I>there is no guarantee that the driver itself is not polling the hardware</I>.
</P>

<P>Although we have no access to Sun's implementation of javax.comm, it is our belief that this implmentation is
    similar to ours in that it has a thread that does the polling and delivery of events. If you dump out Sun's comm.jar
    (jar -tvf comm.jar) you will see this class<BR>
    <FONT FACE="Courier New"> com/sun/comm/NotificationThread.class<BR>
    </FONT></P>

<P>If you dump out jspComm.jar in SerialPort you will see this class<BR>
    <FONT FACE="Courier New"> javax/comm/SerialPortEventTask.class<BR>
    </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"></FONT>We believe that these are functionally equivalent. As for performance, our last
    test showed the implementation provided with SerialPort was about 2% faster than Sun's on WinNT. Considering the
    implementation we provide, sits on top of the SerialPort API, this is quite good. So even if we are wrong, and
    Sun has gone to great links to use 'events' in Win32 (i.e. Overlapped IO) then our polling strategy is still faster.
    As for polling directly with the SerialPort API (i.e. doing essentially what javax.comm.SeralPort does, but directly
    in the application) SerialPort will happily run 96 port (or more) on a single machine.</P>

<P><I><B>Polling is very efficient when done properly</B></I>. </P>

<P><B><U>Example code</U></B></P>

<P>All the serial port example code that ships with the 2.0 release of the Comm API. Has been tested with the Solutions
    Consulting implementation. Depending on your VM, when you run the SimpleWrite.java example you may need to use
    CTL-C to stop the program. You can avoid this by adding the following one line of code to SimpleWrite.java where
    the code exits.

<UL>
    <UL>
        <FONT FACE="Courier New">System.exit(1); //proper exit</FONT>
    </UL>
</UL>

<P>Sun's <I>SerialDemo</I> example: Note when using this example program it may appear that it will not work when
    trying to communicate with a modem. This is NOT a problem with Solutions Consulting javax.comm.SerialPort
    implementation.
    There are two issues here. First some modems (and other devices) will not respond unless the DTR is set, since
    <I>SerialDemo</I> does not provide a hook to set DTR your modem will not send a reply. Secondly, if you note that
    SerialDemo works with your modem on JDK 1.1.x, but not JDK 1.2.x, then this is an issue of a change that Sun made
    to the way the Enter key event is handled. In JDK 1.2.x the Enter key does not send the CR, and the modem will
    not respond until it sees a CR. You should use JavaTerm not SerialDemo, as JavaTerm provides smart and flexible
    CR control as well as the ability to set DTR.</P>

<P><B><U>Implementation Requirements &amp; Limitations</U></B>

<UL>
    <LI>Split flow control (handshake) is not supported for SerialPort versions previous to 3.2.
    <LI>Parallel ports are not currently supported (Parallel ports don’t even exist on many of the platforms that
        SerialPort
        runs on)
    <LI>Port enumeration is not supported for SerialPort versions previous to 4.0.
    <LI>Port enumeration is currently supported only on WinNT/98/95, Mac &amp; OS/2, and only on JNI compliant VM’s.
        This feature requires jspWin.dll version 3.7 or later on Win32 and shared library version 2.8 or later on Mac,
        and 3.2 or later on OS/2.
