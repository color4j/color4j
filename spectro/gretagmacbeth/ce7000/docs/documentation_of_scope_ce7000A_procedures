SCOPE'S CE7000A MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES
======================================

Upon initiation of the measurement panel[1], SCOPE sets the
instrument to the default settings of Large (LAV) aperture,
Specular Component Excluded(SCE) and Ultra Violet Excluded (UVE).

SETTINGS
========
Available settings on the measurment panel are:

Aperture:
    - Large
    - Medium
    - Small
    - Ultra Small

Specular:
    - Included
    - Excluded

Ultra Violet:
    - Included [ UVD64 ]
    - Excluded( Cut-off 400nm )
    - UV Location #1
    - UV Location #2
    - UV Location #3
    - Calibratior 100%

Mode:
    - Reflectance
    - Transmittance

SETTINGS PROCEDURE
==================

The setting of specular and uv filter for the instrument are immediate upon 
selection on the measurment panel, however, the software blocks[2] while the 
setting is being put in place.

As for the aperture[3] what SCOPE does is that everytime the user changes the 
aperture setting, the application prompts the user to change the port plate[4].
From there on I am guessing it does a query on the instrument and checks if
the correct port plate have been inserted. If not it re-prompts the user
until either the prompt is cancelled or when the correct port plate is inserted.

There is also a seperate option where by users are given control of the UV Location
settings. Basically it's a small window where you are given a slider of 0 - 100% and
a pull down menu of the three UV Locations; UVD64, UVAD1 and UVAD2. The slider moves
the filter to whatever is set by the slider. Then the user is expected select save
to save the slider setting to the Instrument's memory. This in my opinion is a bit
redundant as the CE7000A has a user panel[5] that allows user to set the filter position.

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE
=====================

Settings are immediate, as in what is set on the panel is immediately set on the 
instrument. This means at the time the calibration button is clicked calibration
would be performed based on whatever settings the instrument is in at the moment
of calibration initiation. However, if the settings was manually changed by the user
via the user panel[5] then the calibration proceeds but upon completion the panel
is updated to reflect whatever the calibration status reports was the settings.

Calibration was done with a single flash to measure the Black Light Trap and a
single flash to measure the White Tile.

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE
=====================

The measurement process is simple, user is prompt to load the sample. According to
how many measurements required was set on the measurement panel[1], the application
would prompt for next measurement. After completion of the measurements, user is
prompt to enter a name. After the name is entered, the software proceeds to initiate
a subsequent measurement procedure until user selects cancel.
