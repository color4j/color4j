<P>When the serial port is opened, the 'Link to desktop' is checked. If no connection is active, the link is disabled,
    the port is opened, and the link is enabled when the port is closed. When the link is active it works different.
    When SerialConfig.setDisableActiveLink=false (the default) then SerialPort.open will throw an exception saying
    &quot;Remote Link is active&quot;. When SerialConfig.setDisableActiveLink=true the link will be shutdown and
    SerialPort.close
    it will enable it again.</P>

<P>To see &quot;Link to desktop&quot; go to the System app (tap the EPOC icon <IMG SRC="Epoc.gif" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="48"
                                                                                   ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">) then
    press Ctrl-L.</P>

<P>Sending breaks is not supported on the integral ARM serial hardware.</P>

<P>Detecting breaks is not supported on the integral ARM serial hardware.</P>

<P>The transmit and receive buffers are always the same size, and are currently limited to 8192 (size can be modified
    with Professional package)</P>

<P>ARM does not support the Ring Indicator input, so sigRing will always return false.</P>

<P>EPOC timeouts have microsecond resolution in the native code (and use a signed int). This means that the maximum
    read/write timeout available using setTimeoutRx/setTimeoutTx is about 2100 seconds (70 minutes).</P>

<P>EPOC ER5 has a bug that prevents implementation of txBufCount consistent with other platforms. When using
    javax.comm.SerialPort
    <B>OutputStream.flush must be used</B> to insure that the OUTPUT_BUFFER_EMPTY event will be generated. This is
    done in the JavaTerm example when CTRL-F is entered in the send TextArea.</P>

<P>When txDrain is performed on EPOC, it will timeout after the period set by setTimeoutTx. This means if setTimeoutTx=0
    the drain will very likely fail. Normally this would not be an issue since one could use txBufCount to drain the
    queue, however EPOC does provide any way to determine the state of the txQueue without performing a drain. One
    would think that if a drain timed out this information could be used to determine that the txQueue was not empty.
    Unfortunately, EPOC has a bug that 'loses' the first byte in the txQueue when a drain is requested and times
    out.</P>

<P>Writing a length of 0 bytes is functionally equivalent to a txDrain.</P>

<P>The SerialPort native code for EPOC is designed to allow multiple Java threads can be used on the port (e.g.
    JavaTerm runs 3 simultaneous threads on one port). Due to the EPOC architecture however, some care should be used
    when running multiple threads on a single port. First, you<B> MUST </B>ensure all threads that access the port
    (apart from the one calling close) are stopped before closing the port (JavaTerm does this as an example). Second,
    if some thread T issues a command that may block e.g. SerialPortLocal.txDrain (or OutputStream.flush when using
    the comm API) and another thread R thread attempts to access the same port, thread R will block until thread T
    has finished.</P>

<P>When using javax.comm.SerialPort 'Link to desktop' must be disabled manually since javax.comm provides no method
    to control this feature. Customers with javax.comm.SerialPort source license, may modify the code to always disable
    the link if active.</P>

<P>When using javax.comm.SerialPort provides no methods for disabling the remote link you do not call
    SerialPort.setSerialPortParams
    or SerialPort.close from an event callback.</P>

<P>Reads and writes cannot currently be cancelled so rxFlush/txFlush have no affect. Read/write timeouts should
    be used to insure a responsive application in the event that the operation may not complete as expected. (this
    is really no different from other platforms, it is just that EPOC requires code to be more 'strict')</P>

<P>The list of ports reported by EPOC (SerialPortLocal.getPortList) may not accurately reflect the actual available
    devices. For example the netBook will report COMM::0, COMM::1, COMM::2 even when only one serial port is
    available.</P>

<P>The maximum rate of detecting signal changes (e.g. CTS, DSR, CD) on the serial port is about about 4x per second.</P>

<P>Emulator bug EM5: If you 'manually' do XON-XOFF flow control note that the EPOC EM driver appears to have a
    bug where it will obey XOFF, but will not generate XON if the buffer gets empty. This bug is only on the emulator,
    the device works properly.</P>

<P>To enable the Java console on EPOC create the file &quot;console.txt&quot; (no contents are required) and copy
    it to \System\Java (on any drive) on the device. By default JavaTerm directs the console output to the file
    JTermLog.txt.</P>

<P>For more detailed serial port information see E:\sysdoc\cpp\commapi\CSAPI-000.html (if the SDK is installed
    on E:)</P>

<P>The LITE version of SerialPort (i.e. JTermLite) is not built to be installed after the licensed version. has
    been installed. Doing so may prevent some programs from running properly (e.g. JavaTerm).</P>

<P>Misc EPOC Note: When your code encounters a nullPointerException, Java may not be able to be shutdown without
    a reset (SerialPort has no bearing on this).<BR>
