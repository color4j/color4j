<P>The Java SerialPort tool provides access to the serial ports of the computer allowing you to communicate with
    barcode readers, modems, mice, printers, sensors, or any serial device.</P>

<P>The SerialPort tool should work with any Java Virtual Machine (VM) that is compliant with any of the following
    native method implementations provided we support that platform. <BR>

Examples of JNI compliant packages are Sun's JDK 1.1.x and later, Symantec Visual Cafe, Borland JBuilder, IBM VisualAge
for Java, ParcPlace Parts For Java, SuperCede 2.x, IBM JDK for OS/2, Apple's MRJ 2.x. Any Sun JDK 1.1 or later
port running on any platform.also support JNI.</P>
<P>The correct version of the shared library (or DLL) is loaded dynamically when the SerialPort object is created.</P>

<P>The default Serialio and JavaTerm classes are built for use with the JDK 1.1.x. Class files for Java 1.0.2 (supported
    on Win32 only) have also been provided if you're still using JDK 1.0.2.</P>

<P>Note: The Microsoft JDK 1.0 jview does not correctly report an unsatisfied link error when it cannot find a
    DLL. If you launch JavaTerm.exe or use jview JavaTerm and you do not see the JavaTerm GUI window the most likely
    cause is jview cannot find the DLL(s). Also note that the JavaTerm.exe is <B>not</B> a true EXE file and will only
    run if you have the Microsoft VM installed.</P>

<P>Currently, the SerialPort package works with applications or applets. You must remember that to use SerialPort
    with an applet the applet must be 'trusted' i.e. digially signed.&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you purchased a Standard license, then to use SerialPort with a platform other than the one it was initially
    purchased for, the license for the other platform must be purchased. For Example if you purchase SerialPort for
    Windows and want to use it on a Linux system, you must purchase the Linux license. If you have a Platform,
    Professional
    or Enterprise license, support for multiple platforms is included.<BR>
    &nbsp;
<H4><U>Using Packages</U></H4>

<P>Note that SerialPort is 'packaged' and therefore must be installed properly according to CLASSPATH package rules
    in order to function properly. If you wish to use SerialPort in a 'unpackaged' fashion you must purchase the DLL
    sources and modify them. Microsoft Java note: The Serialio classes are packaged only for Microsoft VM 2.x and later,
    if you using an ealier VM you will need to comment out the package and import statements in the source code.
<H4><U>Building Applets</U></H4>

<P>If you are planning to build applets with SerialPort, our Termlet package can be purchased to aid your development.
    The Termlet package includes step-by-step instructions on how Termlet was created, the source code for Termlet,
    the supporting build files, and other useful information related to running applets that access the serial ports
    on the browsers machine.
<H4><U>Installation</U></H4>

<P>This installation assumes you have installed the JDK (Java Developer Kit), or an equivalent product.</P>

<P>Distribution files are packaged in ZIP format (.zip). Use your favorite ZIP tool to unpack the zip files. If
    you don't have a ZIP extractor you can get one for FREE from http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip for almost any
    platform
    in existance. For a Windows specific version get an evaluation copy at http://www.winzip.com.</P>

<P><B>SerialPort API:</B></P>

<P><B><I>Java 2 (aka JDK 1.2.x, 1.3.x)</I></B></P>

<P>One simple step: copy Serialio.jar into your $JavaLib/ext. For example: for the JRE the default directory (on
    Win32) would be &quot;C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.2\lib\ext&quot;. For the JDK the default is
    C:\jdk1.2\jre\lib\ext.
    Note: If your using <B>Visual Cafe 4</B>, this folder would be something like C:\VisualCafe4\Java2\lib\ext. If
    you installed JDK 1.2.2 on Linux in /usr, the directory would be /usr/jdk1.2.2/jre/lib/ext.</P>

<P><B><I>Java 1.1 (Desktop - Pocket devices differ)</I></B></P>

<P>The term $JAVA_HOME used hereafter indicates the default directory/folder where Java searches for the classes.zip
    file. For example, if the JDK 1.1.7 is installed on Windows to the directory c:\jdk117, the default location of
    $JAVA_HOME is C:\jdk1.1.7\lib. If you install Symantec Visual Cafe PDE to the directory C:\VC2PDE, then the default
    location of $JAVA_HOME is C:\VC2PDE\Java\Lib.</P>

<P>1a)&nbsp; Create a directory named Serialio (case sensitive) that is a subdirectory of where the main Java classes
    exist e.g. create the directory C:\jdk1.1.7\lib\Serialio. Note: Some Java implementations on Unix variants may
    require the Serialio files to be placed in the $JAVA_HOME/classes/Serialio directory (you may need to create
    $JAVA_HOME/classes).
    For Microsoft Java use the CLASSPATH option below, or figure out what the currently used base directory name is
    for the version of the MS Java VM that your using is and create a directory named Serialio there. At one time this
    name was&nbsp; %SystemRoot%\Java\Classes where %SystemRoot% is generally C:\Windows for Win95/98 and C:\WinNT for
    WinNT.</P>

<P>1b) If you're using Java 1.0.2, choose or create a directory that is in your current CLASSPATH. If your Java
    development will done in the same directory where the SerialPort files exist, then this directory need not be in
    CLASSPATH.</P>

<P>2) Copy the class files from the Serialio archive to the directory created in 1a/1b.</P>

<P>3) Set you CLASSPATH to <B><I>the parent directory</I></B> of the Serialio directory used in 1a). In this example
    CLASSPATH should include the following <TT>C:\jdk117\lib</TT>. <B>NOTE:</B> Serialio is a package so Java will
    look for it in the Serialio directory, if you point the CLASSPATH to the Serialio directory where the classes are,
    the classes won't be found because Java will search for them in a subdirectory named Serialio of that directory.</P>

<P>Alternatively you can set CLASSPATH to point to the Serialio JAR. If you have installed SerialPort in a directory
    named C:\jsp then add the following to the CLASSPATH setting <TT>C:\jsp\core\Serialio\Serialio.jar</TT></P>

<P><B>Comm API:</B> <BR>
    First install the Serialio.jar as shown above, then follow same instructions as for Serialio.jar above, except
    use the file jspComm.jar</P>

<P>Note: Other tools may install the Sun Comm API JAR file int $JavaLib/ext (e.g. Dallas Semiconductor's iSite
    toolkit). Be sure to remove the Sun JAR file when using this implementation (i.e. in the above example be sure
    you have c:\jdk1.2\jre\lib\ext\jspComm.jar and NOT c:\jdk1.2\jre\lib\ext\comm.jar.</P>

<P>If you are modifying the serialio, or javax.comm.SerialPort source code files it is quicker to create a Serialio
    and javax.comm directories in the CLASSPATH instead rebuilding the JAR(s) each time you want to test. <I><B>A Caveat
        with with Java2</B> </I>if you have jspComm.jar in thejre\lib\ext folder and you remove the Serialio.jar file
    from
    jre\lib\ext folder, then you will likely get a <TT>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Serialio/SerialPortLocal</TT>
    error <I><B>even when you have the proper CLASSPATH setting and the Serialio class files in the proper
        directory.</B></I>
    Apparently (at least with JDK 1.2.2) you cannot have the jspComm.jar in the jre\lib\ext folder and the Serialio
    classes in a directory on the CLASSPATH. If you want to use the directory method you must have the proper javax.comm
    classes in the javax.comm directory, and Serialio classes in the Serialio directory.</P>

<P><B>CLASSPATH Notes:</B> <BR>
    If you get an error similar to the following when trying to build the SerialPort classes, your CLASSPATH is probably
    not set correctly.</P>

<P><TT>SerialPort.java:39: Class Serialio.SerialConfig not found in type</TT> <BR>
    <TT>declaration.</TT> <BR>
    <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void configure(SerialConfig cfgObj) throws IOException;</TT>
    <BR>
    <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ^</TT> <BR>
    <TT>1 error</TT></P>

<P>Depending on what Java platform you're using you may need to include the current directory in your CLASSPATH
    statement. The above example installation for Windows would be as follows <TT>CLASSPATH=.;C:\jdk117\lib </TT>(the
    '.' indicates the current directory).</P>

<P>Note: It is a common mistake to think that the CLASSPATH entry &quot;<TT>C:\jdk117\lib\classes.zip&quot; </TT>is
    the same as <TT>&quot;C:\jdk117\lib;&quot;</TT>. The functionality of these two entries is not the same <I>unless
        you have added all classes existing in the C:\jdk117\lib directory tree to classes.zip</I>. Java searches the
    classpath
    for directory names to match package names, thus for the Serialio package, if it cannot find the class(es) in
    classes.zip
    it will look in C:\jdk117\lib\Serialio.</P>

<P>If you wish to put the Serialio files other than the default location (i.e. $JAVA_HOME/lib/Serialio) be sure
    to add that location to your classpath. For example if you put the Serialio classes in the C:\MyJavaStuff\Serialio,
    you will need to add C:\MyJavaStuff to your classpath.</P>

<P><B>Java2 Notes:</B></P>

<P>When using packages, that the CLASSPATH settings may not behave as expected. For example suppose you run the
    JavaTerm demo using JDK 1.2 (Java 2) and the unpackaged class files (as the demo is shipped) and every thing works
    fine. Next you create a jTerm.jar containing all the JavaTerm class files and put this in the jre\lib\ext folder
    then find that you get an error similar to the following when trying to run JavaTerm.</P>

<P><TT>D:\Some Folder Not Containing The JavaTerm Classes&gt;java JavaTerm</TT></P>

<P><TT>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Serialio/SerialPortLocal</TT> <BR>
    <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at JavaTerm.initPort(JavaTerm.java:430)</TT> <BR>
    <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at JavaTerm.&lt;init&gt;(JavaTerm.java:259)</TT> <BR>
    <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at JavaTerm.main(JavaTerm.java:292)</TT></P>

<P>The reason for this is due to CLASSPATH search behaviour. The solution in this example is to copy Serialio.jar
    to the jre\lib\ext folder.</P>

<P><B>Windows CE / Sun Personal Java Notes:</B></P>

<P>Sun's Personal Java (pJava) should be available from a link on this page
    http://www.javasoft.com/products/personaljava</P>

<P>Supports MIPS, SH3, SH4, ARM</P>

<P>The pJava CLASSPATH bahavior on WinCE is not the same as the destktop. If you wish to use the SerialPort package
    for applications that start by double-clicking on the .CLASS file, you need to do one of the following:</P>

<P>A) Create the directory $JDK_HOME\Classes\Serialio. This is normally &quot;My Handheld PC\Program
    Files\Java\Classes\Serialio&quot;.
    <B><I>This is recommended</I></B>.</P>

<P>B) Create a Serialio directory in the directory of your application, and place the Serialio classes there. Caveat:
    this way only allows the Serialio classes to be seen from the application directory where Serialio is installed.</P>

<P>C) Copy Serialio.jar to a location of your choice, and modify the registry entry as outlined in the pJava readme
    file. For example: copy Serialio.jar to <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">&quot;\Program
        Files\Java\lib&quot; </FONT>then
    change the registy setting to:<BR>
    <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">&quot;\Program Files\Java\bin\pjava.exe&quot; -classpath &quot;\Program<BR>
        Files\Java\lib\Serialio.jar&quot; -file &quot;%1&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>Note: The SerialPort classes can be obtained by unpacking Serialio.jar or rebuilding the sources.</P>

<P>We discovered a bug in pJava beta2 (which has been reported to Sun, and they say should be fixed in FCS) where
    the method System.getProperty(&quot;os.arch&quot;) returns &quot;unknown&quot; for both SH3 &amp; SH4 platforms.
    To use SerialPort on an SH3 or SH4 CPU with beta2 you will need to modify SerialPortLocal.java to force loading
    the DLL name for your platform e.g. <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">jspLib = &quot;jspWceSh3&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<B>Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT</B></P>
<P><BR>
    There are 4 DLLs for Win95, Win98 and WinNT. <BR>
    jspWin.DLL, jspWinNm.DLL, jspWinRni.DLL,&nbsp; jspWinRnia.DLL</P>

<P><B><I>Only jspWin.DLL is required if your using a JNI compliant VM</I></B></P>

<P>Win95/Win98: Copy the DLL(s) to the Windows\System directory.</P>

<P>WinNT/Win2K: Copy the DLL(s) to the Winnt\System32 directory.</P>

<P>Note: Only one of these DLLs is used depending on what Java vendor/version is running. For example jspWin.DLL
    provides the JNI support for SerialPort so if you using the Sun JDK or a JNI compliant Java product like Symantec
    Visual Cafe you only need this DLL.</P>

<P>Note: You can put the DLL can be in any directory if you add that directory to the PATH statement.</P>

<P>Netscape Note: If you plan to use SerialPort with a Netscape Communicator applet you will need to put the JNI
    dll Netscape\Communicator\Program\java\bin folder.</P>

<P><B>If your using Windows Explorer with the default settings you will not be able to see the .DLL files. To see
    the DLL files with Windows Explorer, verify the following on the </B><I><B>View</B></I><B> panel under </B><I><B>View
    | Options</B></I><B>: 1) &quot;Show all files&quot; is checked, 2) &quot;Hide file extensions for known file types&quot;
    is not checked.</B></P>

<P><BR>
    <B>PATH Notes:</B> <BR>
    Depending on what your system configuration is, you may have multiple Java VMs installed. Be sure your path is
    set up to find the VM you wish to use first. If for example, if you have Microsoft IE installed, and have also
    installed the Java VM option, you will have the Microsoft Java VM in your default path. If you then install another
    VM e.g. JDK1.1.8, you will need to modify your path to find the Sun VM. For example suppose you install JDK 1.1.8
    into C:\jdk1.1.8 you would be sure your PATH is set such that C:\jdk1.1.8\bin comes before your Windows\System
    or WinNT\System directory. Note also that Java 2 (JDK1.2.x) installs a Java.exe in the default Windows directory,
    so if you wish to use another VM (say JDK 1.1.x) you would need to modify your path in a similar fashion.</P>

<P>

&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>Unix In General Note:</B> If things don't work or if things stop working after an upgrade, be sure to check
    that file privileges are set properly according to the access your trying to perform. For example: in general,
    you must install the shared libraries as root, however when doing so, you will typically need to change file
    privileges
    to allow other users access to the SerialPort files. Some upgrades will set file set privileges on all devices
    to read-only for root, typically you will need to set them for a+rw. For example you could create a script as shown
    below. Be sure to use the shared library name for your platform.</P>

<P><B>FTP Note:</B> If you use FTP to transfer shared library files, CLASS, or JAR you MUST use BINARY mode or
    the resulting files will not work properly.</P>

<P><B>CLASSPATH Note:</B> On later versions of the JDK (on Linux at least) the install is very nice in that you
    don't need to set anything to use the JDK, you simply unpack it. Note however the CLASSPATH search does not work
    identical to that of earlier JDK installs where the CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME settings were required. e.g. If you
    elected to install the Serialio class files instead of using the Serialio.jar, you might put the Serialio classes
    into the <FONT FACE="Courier New">JDK_HOME/lib</FONT> directory, say <FONT
            FACE="Courier New">jdk117_v3/lib/Serialio</FONT>.
    If you do this without setting your CLASSPATH to include <FONT FACE="Courier New">jdk117_v3/lib</FONT> the classes
    will not be found by default as with earlier versions of the JDK. If you want to use the Serialio.jar file, and
    your using a JDK1.1.x VM, you can simply add this file to your classpath. For example if you have JDK on <FONT
            FACE="Courier New, Courier">/myStuff/jdk117_v3</FONT> partition, and you unpack the SerialPort package into
    the
    <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">/jsp</FONT> directory add the following to your <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">.bash_profile</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">JDK_HOME=/myStuff/jdk117_v3<BR>
    export CLASSPATH=$JDK_HOME/lib:/myStuff/jsp/Core/Serialio/Serialio.jar</FONT></P>

<P><B>Shared Lib location note:</B> Some Unix Java installations are more 'sensitive' to the location of the shared
    lib (esp Java 2). If you have linkage problems put the shared lib <FONT FACE="Courier New">JRE_HOME/lib/xxx</FONT>
    where xxx is the CPU architecture. For example on Linux x86 with put libjspLux.so.x.y in <FONT FACE="Courier New">JRE_HOME/lib/i386</FONT>.
    Note on later versions of the JDK that support native threads (e.g.JDK 1.1.7) the CPU architecture directory is
    a symbolic link, so you would put the shared library in the thread model directory of the CPU architecture
    directory,
    e.g. <FONT FACE="Courier New">JRE_HOME/lib/i686/green_threads</FONT>.</P>

<P><B>Shared library:</B> There is one shared library for each platform.

<UL>
    <B>Linux: </B>libjspLux86.so.3.3 <BR>

    <B>SCO UnixWare IA32: </B>libjspUxWareIA32.so.3.3
    <P>Copy the shared library to some directory (if Java 2 use JRE_HOME/lib/i386) and rename it from .so.x.y, to .so,
        (or use symbolic links as shown below) then export the directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
        variable.
        <BR>

        <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT></P>

    <P>Note: the double link shown is based on the traditional way to link major &amp; minor revisions in Unix. If
        you want, you can directly link to the shared lib i.e. <TT><FONT FACE="Courier New">ln -s libjspLux86.so.3.3
            libjspLux86.so.</FONT></TT>
        or you can simply rename the shared lib to libjspLux86.so</P>

    <P><B>AIX Notes</B>: We recommend using JDK 1.1.4 or later on AIX.</P>

    <P>For AIX the shared library must be in the path pointed to by LIBPATH environment variable. The example above

<B>Macintosh</B>

<UL>
    The only VM currently supported VM for the Macintosh is Apple's MRJ. The Serialio library for use with MRJ is &quot;jspMac_MRJ_PPC.&quot;
    The version number of library in SerialPort version 4.9 is version 3.3. It has been tested with Apple's MRJ 2.2.
    <P>The two other libraries that are included in this package were written for the now discontinued Metrowerks VM.
        The &quot;jspMac_PPC&quot; library works with the standard VM from CodeWarrior Pro 4.0, &quot;jspMac_JIT_PPC
        &quot;
        works with the JIT VM from the same version of CodeWarrior. These libraries are deprecated and will not be
        supported
        in future releases of SerialPortMac.</P>

    <P>The shared library for the Metrowerks VM can be placed in the extensions folder. The Apple MRJ library should
        be placed in the MRJ Libraries folder, which is itself in the Extensions folder. The libraries will be available
        to the Java VM immediately; rebooting the computer is not necessary. If you are using more than one Java VM you
        must have the library for each VM in the proper folder. Having more than one jspMac library will cause no
        conflicts
        for the SerialPort Java software.

<B>OS/2</B>

<UL>
    There are 2 DLL's for OS/2 sccomio.DLL, jspos2j.DLL
    <P>Copy the DLLs into a directory specified in the LIBPATH setting of the CONFIG.SYS file. Note that &quot;.&quot;
        is placed in LIBPATH by default when OS/2 is installed, so the current directory will work unless the &quot;.&quot;
        Specification has been removed from LIBPATH.</P>

    <P>The OS/2 COMM DLL is licensed from Oberon Software.</P>

    <P>Early releases of the IBM JDK 1.1.4 have a bug that causes the VM to report it is running on Window 95 even
        when running on OS/2. You will need to modify SerialPortLocal.java such that jspLib = &quot;jspos2j&quot; in the
        section of code where jspLib is determined.</P>

    <P>If your using <I>only</I> the CommAPI you another option would be to consider the implementation from

<P><B>Java Beans</B>

<UL>
    If your using a Java Bean compliant tool like Visual Cafe or JBuilder, you can install the SerialPortLocal bean
    in the component library, or tool palette (or whatever your Java tool calls this). Note that the Bean JAR file
    does not contain the native shared library so the native shared library must be installed as outlined above. Note
    also that the SerialPortLocal Bean does not contain the extender classes (e.g. SerLooker, SerInputStream,
    SerOutputStream.

<P><B>Package Notes</B> <BR>
    Do not change the package name when importing the <I>Serialio</I> package into Visual Age for Java or other Java
    tools that allow you to import the package with another name. If you do this the application will fail to link
    properly when calling the SerialPort shared library.</P>
