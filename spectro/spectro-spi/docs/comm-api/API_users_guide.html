        Java(tm) Communications API Users Guide</H1>
    <I>Version 2.0</I>

        <A HREF="../COMM2.0_license.txt">License</A>
</center>

<P>This document provides an overview of the components of the Java(tm)
    communications
    API, which is a standard extension to the Java platform. It is not a tutorial;
    readers should know the basics of serial and parallel port programming,
    and be comfortable reading the Java communications API <A HREF="packages.html">reference
        pages</A>.

<P>Like all Java standard extensions, the Java communications
    API is intended to be implementable from specification by third parties.

<P>
<HR>
<H2>
    <TT>javax.comm</TT> Extension Package</H2>

<P>There are three levels of classes in the Java communications API:
<UL>
    <LI>
        High-level classes like <TT>CommPortIdentifier</TT> and <TT>CommPort</TT>
        manage access and ownership of communication ports.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Low-level classes like <TT>SerialPort</TT> and <TT>ParallelPort</TT> provide
        an interface to physical communications ports. The current release of the
        Java communications API enables access to serial (RS-232) and
        parallel (IEEE 1284) ports.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Driver-level classes provide an interface between the low-level classes
        and the underlying operating system. Driver-level classes are part of the
        implementation but not the Java communications API. They should
        not be used by application programmers.
    </LI>
</UL>
The <TT>javax.comm</TT> package provides the following basic services:
<UL>
    <LI>
        Enumerate the available ports on the system. The static method <TT>CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers</TT>
        returns an enumeration object that contains a <TT>CommPortIdentifier</TT>
        object for each available port. This <TT>CommPortIdentifier</TT> object
        is the central mechanism for controlling access to a communications port.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Open and claim ownership of communications ports by using the high level
        methods in their <TT>CommPortIdentifier</TT> objects.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Resolve port ownership contention between multiple Java applications. Events
        are propagated to notify interested applications of ownership contention
        and allow the port's owner to relinquish ownership. <TT>PortInUseException</TT>
        is thrown when an application fails to open the port.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Perform asynchronous and synchronous I/O on communications ports. Low-level
        classes like <TT>SerialPort</TT> and <TT>ParallelPort</TT> have methods
        for managing I/O on communications ports.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Receive events describing communication port state changes. For example,
        when a serial port has a state change for Carrier Detect, Ring Indicator,
        DTR, etc. the <TT>SerialPort</TT> object propagates a <TT>SerialPortEvent</TT>
        that describes the state change.
    </LI>
</UL>

<H2>
    A Simple Reading Example</H2>
<TT><A HREF="../samples/Simple/SimpleRead.java">SimpleRead.java</A></TT> opens
a serial port and creates a thread for asynchronously reading data through
an event callback technique.
<H2>
    A Simple Writing Example</H2>
<TT><A HREF="../samples/Simple/SimpleWrite.java">SimpleWrite.java</A></TT>
opens a serial port for writing data.
<H2>
    Solaris Notes</H2>
The Solaris implementation of the Java communications API requires
the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">Solaris Native Threads
    Pack</A> for JDK 1.1.x.

<P>Here's how to test the <TT>SimpleRead.java</TT> example above on Solaris:
<OL>
    <LI>
        Attach a null-modem cable between two serial ports.
    </LI>

    <LI>
        Start <TT>tip</TT>(1) on one of the serial ports:
    </LI>

    <PRE>% tip -9600 /dev/term/b</PRE>

    <LI>
        Compile <TT>SimpleRead.java</TT>:
    </LI>

    <PRE>% javac SimpleRead.java</PRE>

    <LI>
        Run <TT>SimpleRead</TT>:
    </LI>

    <PRE>% java -native SimpleRead</PRE>

    <LI>
        Type text into the <TT>tip</TT>(1) window.
    </LI>
</OL>
