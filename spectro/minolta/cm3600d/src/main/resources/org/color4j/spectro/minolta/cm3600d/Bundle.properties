OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: Long Description of Minolta Driver

MSG_INTERRUPTED=The waiting loop was interrupted.

MSG_OK=Requested procedure was performed and no wanring condition occurred.

MSG_WARN_LIGHT=The quantity of light from the pulsed xenon lamp was low.

MSG_ERROR_LAMP1=The Spectophotometer's pulsed xenon lamp did not flash.

MSG_ERROR_CALIBRATION1=Zero calibration and white (100%) calibration have not flash.

MSG_ERROR_CALIBRATION2=White (100%) calibration or zero calibration was not performed correctly.

MSG_ERROR_CONVERTERS=Error in Spectrophotometer's A/D converters.

MSG_ERROR_DATA=Data in Spectrophotometer's EEPROM were destroyed.

MSG_ERROR_WHITE_ERROR=White (100%) calibration has not been performed.

MSG_ERROR_TARGET=Target mask has not been attached / Attached target mask is for smaller measurement area than the selected measurement area.

MSG_ERROR_MOTOR=The motor for changing the measurement area, changing the UV amount, or switching between SCI and SCE is not operation properly.
